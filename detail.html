                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <p>GHG emissions produced by Indonesia over the last 20 years reached 1,702.9 Megatons CO2 equivalent or equivalent to 7.29% of average GHG emissions per year. The average greenhouse gas emissions generated from 1 ton of food waste are 4.3 times that of leftover.
